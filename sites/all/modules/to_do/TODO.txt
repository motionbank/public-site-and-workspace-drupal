Ideas of things to do to ameliorate this module:

* Write a little something about the supported API.
* Look into how deleted users are handled (i.e. To do
  items should not generally go without someone being
  assigned to them, use a default user or #1 and maybe
  have a trigger too.)
* Tabs & lack of Urgent entries with the Hide when empty
  feature turned on... makes your block go away with no
  possibility to come back to All until a new task is
  created that is immediate.
* Verify the sorting order between priority & deadline
  dates; it looks like immediate without a deadline date
  is put AFTER anything else with a date!
* Use the user block title if any (gets overwritten by
  the JSON at this time.)
* When removing a user from to_do Roles (whether manually
  or automatically), then it should automatically be
  unassigned from all To Do items that he cannot access
  anymore (see Delete problem)
* Trigger events when:
  - a new assignment was created
  - user receives a new assignment
  - user is removed from an assignment
  - work started (system event)
  - reminders (system event)
  - deadline is approaching (sytem event)
  - deadline is reached (sytem event)
  - went past the deadline (sytem event)
  - work marked as finished (system event)
  - an assignment was deleted (system event)
* Add a "Last updated date" column in the tables (using node.changed)
* Add a block to display last few finished
* Add a block with actions (Mark started, finished, etc.)
* Hide the "Add users" if there are no others who can be added
  (possibly count the number that can be added and if 10 or less
  show the names directly?)
* Increment selection for CRON (at this time it is
  1 day and that would do no good for tasks with
  hours and minutes specified!)
* Add an interval to know how much to show backward
  (i.e. to show a few of what was finished in the list
  block)
* Replace the start_date & deadline fields from type
  "date" to type "textfield" (maybe with a flag so
  users who prefer the "date" type could still use it.)
* Change the date selector with the Date API and
  the little JavaScript widget (much easier to use
  than THREE drop-downs.)
* Add a block with stats (graph?!)
* Add other buttons to the To Do as long as it is not
  marked finished, got Mark Started now (i.e. need more
  info, etc.)
* Let user define what is Urgent and what is not.
  (i.e. Medium, High, Immediate)
* Flag to hide any "Low" event when All is selected.
  (actually a list of the accepted priorities)
* Fix the title teaser with a pop-up ala Overlib so
  we can show it in HTML.
* Set defaults for new To do items:
  - Auto-assigned users and/or self
  - Priority
  - Status
* Think about offering the fields as tokens to
  pathauto (and other modules, i.e. filters, etc.)
* Check whether we could make the fields available
  in CCK fields?
