A note on access control for the workspace.

We are using a module called "Taxonomy Access Control" (TAC) along with "Organic Groups" (OG). 
Any group posts are set to be private. This is overridden by a TAC taxonomy with 3 terms:
"anyone", "all members", "group only". Per default anonymous users can't see anything, this is
overridden by the term "anyone" (set to "allow view node"). Any node (be it in a group or not)
having that term is visible on the world level. Posts not in a group are automatically set to
"all members" if they are not "anyone" and therefore visible to all logged in users. Group
posts set to "group only" (same as "private" in OG) are only visible to members of that group.
